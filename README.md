## üöÄ How It Works

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Deposit ETH as Collateral

Users deposit ETH to open a collateralized position.

```solidity
borrowX.depositCollateral{value: 1 ether}();
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Mint xUSDC Against Collateral
Users can mint up to 50% of the USD value of their deposited ETH.

```solidity
borrowX.mintxUSDC(500 * 1e18); // Mint up to allowed amount based on LTV
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Repay Debt by Burning xUSDC
Users can reduce their outstanding debt and avoid liquidation by burning xUSDC.

```solidity
borrowX.burnxUSDC(200 * 1e18);
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ Withdraw ETH Collateral
If the borrowing position allows (based on LTV and debt), users can withdraw collateral.

```solidity
borrowX.withdrawCollateral(0.5 ether);
```

5Ô∏è‚É£ Close Position (Repay All Debt and Withdraw All Collateral)
To completely close a position, users repay all outstanding xUSDC and redeem all remaining ETH.

```solidity
borrowX.closePosition();
```

6Ô∏è‚É£ Liquidate Undercollateralized Positions
If a position‚Äôs LTV exceeds 80%, it can be liquidated by anyone for a 10% collateral bonus.

```solidity
borrowX.liquidate(targetUser);
```
