# üìú BorrowX Protocol

A decentralized borrowing protocol on Ethereum that allows users to deposit ETH as collateral and mint **xUSDC**, a USD-pegged stablecoin backed by ETH. BorrowX ensures over-collateralization and offers incentives for liquidators to maintain system solvency.

## üìñ Overview

BorrowX enables users to:

- **Deposit ETH** as collateral.
- **Mint xUSDC** against their ETH up to a **50% Loan-To-Value (LTV)** ratio.
- **Withdraw ETH** when their borrowing position allows.
- **Burn xUSDC** to repay debt and reduce liquidation risk.
- **Close positions** by repaying all debt and redeeming all collateral.
- **Liquidate undercollateralized positions**, earning a **10% bonus** on collateral value.
